Have you ever wanted to run a server for each of the games you played? Or maybe you want to be able to swap what server is currently running without a hassle. You can with the Server handler!

I learned from the simon assignment:
- never draw with html
- I give in when it comes to copy and paste strings of numbers :) but I did make sure I knew what it was doing and played around with it :) 
- I need to create more bash scripts for my personal projects
- There is a lot of variety in html
I learned from the second simon assignment
- bootstrap is almost like css in the html, meaning it makes the css shorter and easyer to use
- Drawing is a lot easier in css
- You can have position absolute but have it dynamic
- Most pages dont need a ton of css with bootstrap, only unique ones
